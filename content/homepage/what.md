**When you’re stuck, I get you unstuck.** Fast.

If you’re spinning in circles, unable to make a decision, or drowning in inefficiency, I pinpoint what’s really going on and give you a concrete plan forward. I don’t just listen and reflect—I **solve the problem** with you.

Some examples:

- **Stay or Go?** You’re agonizing over whether to leave your marriage. You’ve listed the pros and cons, talked in circles with friends, and still feel paralyzed. I cut through the noise. What’s **actually** keeping you stuck? What’s **truly** important to you? I’ll help you see the decision with fresh clarity—and make a choice you can stand behind.
  
- **The Hiring Blind Spot.** You keep hiring people who turn out to be… not great. They seem promising, but they don’t perform. After listening for a while, I tell you: *You’re hiring for enthusiasm because you’re afraid of competence.* You need someone who challenges you, not someone who makes you feel like the smartest person in the room. That one shift changes everything—your next hire is a game-changer.
  
- **The Broken System Overhaul.** You have a recurring project (a conference, an annual report, a kid’s birthday) that feels like total chaos every single time. You think, *There has to be a better way.* There is. I design a system that works **every single time**—so you never have to reinvent the wheel again.
  
This is for you if you want **clear, incisive, directive guidance.** You don’t want vague brainstorming or endless reflection—you want someone to **see the problem clearly and tell you what to do.**
  
Sometimes a single session gets you exactly what you need. Sometimes you need ongoing support. Either way, you’ll leave our work with **clear next steps you can actually act on.**
