A colleague once warned a room full of people: *“Be careful what you say around Live—if you describe a problem, she’ll solve it before you’ve even finished the sentence.”* They weren’t wrong.

I see patterns fast. Problems that feel like a tangled mess to you are crystal clear to me. If you’re spinning in circles, I’ll pinpoint what’s really going on. If you don’t know what to do next, I’ll tell you exactly what to do.

For years, I applied this skill in my own life and in conversations with friends and colleagues—until I realized that it’s a rare and valuable ability. Now, I use it in service of others: cutting through the noise, identifying what actually matters, and offering clear, actionable solutions.

I don’t deal in abstract theories or vague brainstorming. I solve real problems, fast. And I do it with deep care—because the best solution is the one that works for *you*. If you want someone to help you get unstuck, I’m here. Let’s figure it out together.
